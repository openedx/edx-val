# Version constraints for pip installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.


# Constraining this since we haven't handled newer versions of Django Rest Framework
# and we want to allow edx-platform to update this separately.
djangorestframework==3.9.4

# zipp 2.0.0 requires Python >= 3.6
zipp==1.0.0

# edx-toggles is set to 1.2.2 because we need `edx_toggles.toggles.__future__`
# we also expect v2.0.0 to introduce breaking changes in the feature toggle API
edx-toggles==1.2.2
